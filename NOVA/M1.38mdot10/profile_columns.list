! profile_columns.list -- determines the contents of star model profiles
! you can use a non-standard version by setting profile_columns_file in your inlist

! units are cgs unless otherwise noted.

! reorder the following names as desired to reorder columns.
! comment out the name to omit a column (fewer columns => less IO => faster running).
! remove '!' to restore a column.

! if you have a situation where you want a non-standard set of columns,
! make a copy of this file, edit as desired, and give the new filename in your inlist
! as profile_columns_file.   if you are just adding columns, you can 'include' this file,
! and just list the additions in your file.   note: to include the standard default
! version, use include '' -- the 0 length string means include the default file.

! if you need to have something added to the list of options, let me know....


! the first few lines of the profile contain general info about the model.
! for completeness, those items are described at the end of this file.


! note: you can include another list by doing
!        include 'filename'
!        include '' means include the default standard list file


! the following lines of the profile contain info for 1 zone per row, surface to center.
   
   zone ! numbers start with 1 at the surface
   logT ! log10(temperature) at center of zone
   logRho ! log10(density) at center of zone
   logP ! log10(pressure) at center of zone
   logR ! log10(radius/Rsun) at outer boundary of zone
   luminosity ! luminosity at outer boundary of zone (in Lsun units)
   velocity ! velocity at outer boundary of zone -- 0 if no velocity variable
   eta ! electron degeneracy parameter (eta >> 1 for significant degeneracy)
   mu ! mean molecular weight per gas particle (ions + free electrons)
   grada ! dlnT_dlnP at constant S
   !gamma1 ! dlnP_dlnRho at constant S
   !gamma3 ! gamma3 - 1 = dlnT_dlnRho at constant S
   eps_nuc ! ergs/g/sec from nuclear reactions (neutrinos subtracted)
   non_nuc_neu ! non-nuclear-reaction neutrino losses
   eps_grav ! heat from gravitational contraction (negative for expansion)
   gradT ! mlt value for required temperature gradient dlnT/dlnP
   gradr ! dlnT/dlnP required for purely radiative transport
   mass ! m/Msun. mass coordinate of outer boundary of cell.
